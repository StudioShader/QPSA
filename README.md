[here is the presentation for this project](presentation.pdf)


Code provided for article Zhang, K., Rao, P., Yu, K., Lim, H., & Korepin, V. (2021). Implementation of efficient quantum search algorithms on NISQ computers. Quantum Information Processing, 20(7). doi:10.1007/s11128-021-03165-2 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03165-2)


To run code:
1. clone onto your local device
2. open Grover.ipynb
3. make sure all the necessary libraries are installed in your environment
4. run Grover.ipynb


  It will take some time to run all cells. Pre-baked results located in .ipynb_ckeckpoints
